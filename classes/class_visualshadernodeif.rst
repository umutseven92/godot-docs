VisualShaderNodeIf
==================

**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Compares two floating-point numbers in order to return a required vector within the visual shader graph.
