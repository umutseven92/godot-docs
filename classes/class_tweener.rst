**Inherits:** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

**Inherited By:** :ref:`CallbackTweener<class_CallbackTweener>`, :ref:`IntervalTweener<class_IntervalTweener>`, :ref:`MethodTweener<class_MethodTweener>`, :ref:`PropertyTweener<class_PropertyTweener>`

Abstract class for all Tweeners used by :ref:`Tween<class_Tween>`.

Description
-----------

Tweeners are objects that perform a specific animating task, e.g. interpolating a property or calling a method at a given time. A ``Tweener`` can't be created manually, you need to use a dedicated method from :ref:`Tween<class_Tween>` or :ref:`Node<class_Node>`.

Signals
-------

.. _class_Tweener_signal_finished:

- **finished** **(** **)**

Emitted when the ``Tweener`` has just finished its job.
