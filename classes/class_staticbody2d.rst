**Inherits:** :ref:`PhysicsBody2D<class_PhysicsBody2D>` **<** :ref:`CollisionObject2D<class_CollisionObject2D>` **<** :ref:`Node2D<class_Node2D>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_CanvasItem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

**Inherited By:** :ref:`AnimatableBody2D<class_AnimatableBody2D>`

Physics body for 2D physics which is static or moves only by script. Useful for floor and walls.

Description
-----------

Static body for 2D physics.

A static body is a simple body that can't be moved by external forces or contacts. It is ideal for implementing objects in the environment, such as walls or platforms. In contrast to :ref:`RigidDynamicBody2D<class_RigidDynamicBody2D>`, it doesn't consume any CPU resources as long as they don't move.

They have extra functionalities to move and affect other bodies:

**Static transform change:** Static bodies can be moved by animation or script. In this case, they are just teleported and don't affect other bodies on their path.

**Constant velocity:** When :ref:`constant_linear_velocity<class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_linear_velocity>` or :ref:`constant_angular_velocity<class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_angular_velocity>` is set, static bodies don't move themselves but affect touching bodies as if they were moving. This is useful for simulating conveyor belts or conveyor wheels.

.. _class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_angular_velocity:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **constant_angular_velocity**

+-----------+--------------------------------------+
| *Default* | ``0.0``                              |
+-----------+--------------------------------------+
| *Setter*  | set_constant_angular_velocity(value) |
+-----------+--------------------------------------+
| *Getter*  | get_constant_angular_velocity()      |
+-----------+--------------------------------------+

The body's constant angular velocity. This does not rotate the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were rotating.

.. _class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_linear_velocity:

- :ref:`Vector2<class_Vector2>` **constant_linear_velocity**

+-----------+-------------------------------------+
| *Default* | ``Vector2(0, 0)``                   |
+-----------+-------------------------------------+
| *Setter*  | set_constant_linear_velocity(value) |
+-----------+-------------------------------------+
| *Getter*  | get_constant_linear_velocity()      |
+-----------+-------------------------------------+

The body's constant linear velocity. This does not move the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were moving.

.. _class_StaticBody2D_property_physics_material_override:

- :ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>` **physics_material_override**

+----------+--------------------------------------+
| *Setter* | set_physics_material_override(value) |
+----------+--------------------------------------+
| *Getter* | get_physics_material_override()      |
+----------+--------------------------------------+

The physics material override for the body.

If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
