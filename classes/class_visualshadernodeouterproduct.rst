VisualShaderNodeOuterProduct
============================

**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Calculates an outer product of two vectors within the visual shader graph.

Description
-----------

``OuterProduct`` treats the first parameter ``c`` as a column vector (matrix with one column) and the second parameter ``r`` as a row vector (matrix with one row) and does a linear algebraic matrix multiply ``c * r``, yielding a matrix whose number of rows is the number of components in ``c`` and whose number of columns is the number of components in ``r``.
