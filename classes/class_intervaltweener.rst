IntervalTweener
===============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Tweener<class_Tweener>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Creates an idle interval in a :ref:`Tween<class_Tween>` animation.

Description
-----------

``IntervalTweener`` is used to make delays in a tweening sequence. See :ref:`Tween.tween_interval<class_Tween_method_tween_interval>` for more usage information.

**Note:** :ref:`Tween.tween_interval<class_Tween_method_tween_interval>` is the only correct way to create ``IntervalTweener``. Any ``IntervalTweener`` created manually will not function correctly.
